### What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
The load balancer distribute traffic among multiple according to the specified weight (Weighted Scheduling)

### Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
Active-Active setup all servers actively handles traffice suimultaneously distributing load evenly across servers 

Active - Passive One server actively handles traffic while the other is kept at standby for backup in the event of a flaw

### How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
Ensure constanct data availability and redundancy by replicating databased from master to slave database

### What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
Primary node accept write operation and source of truth for the database

Replica node accept read operation and replicate data from primary node to ensure data redundancy

## Infrastructure Problem
SPOF (Single Point of Failure) No fallout mechanism, load balancer may be single point of failure

No firewall exposes the server to unauthorized access
HTTP is an insecure protocol therefore HTTPS should be use to encrypt data transmission from server to client and vice versa
